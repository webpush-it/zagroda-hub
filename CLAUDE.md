## 10xDevs AI Toolkit — Module 1, Lesson 1

Bootstrap a greenfield project end-to-end with the **shaping chain**:

```
/10x-init  →  /10x-shape  →  /10x-prd  →  (10x-tech-stack-selector)  →  (bootstrapper)
```

The first three skills ship in this lesson; the last two are the next links in the chain.

### Task Router — Where to start

| Skill                   | Use it when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project setup**       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `/10x-init`             | The project directory is fresh. Scaffolds `context/foundation/lessons.md` and `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` so the rest of the workflow has somewhere to write. Run this once per project.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Discovery**           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `/10x-shape`            | You have an idea and need to turn it into structured shape-notes BEFORE writing a PRD. Greenfield only. Walks vision → persona/access → MVP → FRs (with Socratic challenge) → business logic & data → stack-openness sketch. Surfaces empty-CRUD and MVP-too-big anti-patterns by name. Output: `context/foundation/shape-notes.md` with a resumable `checkpoint:` block. |
| **Document generation** |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `/10x-prd`              | You have shape-notes (or raw notes) and want a schema-conformant `context/foundation/prd.md`. Generates against the locked schema, routes every gap verbatim into `## Open Questions`, and refuses to invent domain decisions. On collision, prompts overwrite vs. versioned save (`prd-vN.md`).                                                                          |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-init` produces the workflow v2 scaffold (`context/foundation/`, `lessons.md`, `contract-surfaces.md`). `/10x-shape` requires this and will offer to delegate to `/10x-init` if it's missing.
- `/10x-shape` writes `context/foundation/shape-notes.md` with frontmatter `checkpoint:` (current_phase, phases_completed, frs_drafted, quality_check_status). On re-entry, it resumes from the next unfinished phase.
- `/10x-prd` reads `shape-notes.md` (default) or any path you pass, scores the input on a 4-signal heuristic, warns on thin input, and writes `context/foundation/prd.md` against the schema at `skills/10x-shape/references/prd-schema.md` (frontmatter aligned 1:1 with 10x-tech-stack-selector's Q1–Q7).

### What the PRD captures (and what it does NOT)

- **Captured**: vision, persona, success criteria, user stories (Given/When/Then), FRs (FR-NNN), NFRs, business logic (one-sentence rule first), data model, access control, durable implementation decisions, testing strategy, deployment & CI/CD strategy, non-goals, open questions.
- **NOT captured (deliberate)**: framework choices, database choices, file paths, deployment platform. Stack openness is binding — only `product_type` and `tech_preferences.language_family` capture stack-shaped intent. Frameworks are 10x-tech-stack-selector's job.

### Anti-patterns surfaced during shaping

- **Empty-CRUD**: business logic that reduces to "users add and remove records" with no domain rule. `/10x-shape` names it explicitly and prompts for a real rule shape (recommendation, prioritization, classification, validation, scoring, workflow, calculation).
- **MVP-too-big**: first-flow estimate exceeds ~1 week of after-hours work, or > 4 distinct user actions before user-visible value, or requires multiple integrations before payoff. Skill names the expensive pieces and offers concrete scope-down moves.

Both are **soft gates**: they warn but allow override. Overrides are recorded in the checkpoint and surfaced in the PRD's `## Open Questions`.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/shape-notes.md` — `/10x-shape` output
- `context/foundation/prd.md` (or `prd-vN.md`) — `/10x-prd` output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` — recurring rules & pitfalls (scaffolded by `/10x-init`)
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` — load-bearing names registry (scaffolded by `/10x-init`)

### Universal language

The shipped skills carry no 10xDevs / cohort / certification references. The mechanics (Socratic challenge, gray-area discovery, recommended-answer fatigue mitigation, soft quality gate) are universal indicators of a well-scoped greenfield project.

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 1

Open Module 3 by producing a **durable, risk-first quality contract** before any test is written — then drive each rollout phase through the standard change chain.

```
PRD + roadmap + archive
        │
        ▼
   /10x-test-plan  ──►  context/foundation/test-plan.md  (strategy §1–§5 frozen + cookbook §6 grows)
        │
        ▼  (one rollout phase at a time, /clear between handoffs)
   /10x-new ──► /10x-research ──► /10x-plan ──► /10x-implement
```

`/10x-test-plan` is a **stateful orchestrator**, not a one-shot generator. On first run it writes the phased rollout to `context/foundation/test-plan.md`. On every subsequent run it re-derives state from on-disk artifacts and presents the next handoff. The lesson focus is **strategy and rollout sequencing, not configuration**. Hooks, MCP servers, and CI YAML are configured in later lessons of this module.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Quality strategy as a rules-file (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-test-plan` | You have a PRD (and ideally a roadmap and a few archived slices) and you are about to write the project's first tests, or you noticed that AI-generated tests are landing on helpers while critical flows go uncovered. First invocation runs discovery (PRD + roadmap + archive + hot-spot scan), a 5-question user interview, and a synthesis pass with a mandatory challenger check, then writes `test-plan.md` in `context/foundation/` with a risk map (5–7 failure scenarios), a phased rollout table, a stack table, a quality-gates table, a cookbook section (`§6`, fills in as phases ship), and a negative-space section (what we deliberately don't test). Subsequent invocations advance the rollout one handoff at a time. |
| `/10x-test-plan --status` | A `test-plan.md` already exists and you want a compact snapshot of where the rollout stands — which phases are `not started`, `change opened`, `researched`, `planned`, `implementing`, or `complete`, and what the next action is. Does no work; safe to run any time. |
| `/10x-test-plan --refresh` | A `test-plan.md` already exists and one of: a new top-3 risk surfaced from the roadmap or archive, a tool's `checked:` date is older than three months, the project's tech stack changed, or §7 negative-space no longer matches what the team believes. Opens a new `test-plan-refresh-<YYYY-MM-DD>` change folder rather than editing the guide in place. |

### Rollout chain — what happens after the guide is written

The guide's §3 *Phased Rollout* table is the orchestrator's state. For each non-`complete` row the orchestrator selects the next handoff based on which artifacts exist in `context/changes/<change-id>/`:

| State on disk | Next handoff | Status transitions to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| change folder missing | `/10x-new <change-id>` | `change opened` |
| `change.md` only | `/10x-research` (with a risks-to-verify brief) | `researched` |
| `+ research.md` | `/10x-plan` (with cost × signal + cookbook-update constraints) | `planned` |
| `+ plan.md` with pending `## Progress` items | `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <N>` | `implementing` / `complete` |
| `+ plan.md` fully `[x]` | Mark §3 row `complete`; loop to next pending row | — |

Each handoff is a **STOP point**. The orchestrator copies the next command to the clipboard, asks the user to `/clear` and run it, then exits. Re-invoke `/10x-test-plan` (no arguments) to advance.

### Risk-first prioritization rules

- Risks are **failure scenarios in user / business terms**, not test names. "Logged-out user reaches paid content via stale token" is a risk; "test the login form" is not.
- 5 to 7 risks. Fewer is too coarse; more makes prioritization useless.
- Impact and likelihood are user/business ratings, not technical complexity.
- Every risk traces to a source: PRD section, archived slice, roadmap entry, Phase 2 interview question, hot-spot **directory** with churn count, or a tech-stack constraint. No invented risks.
- **Signal, not knowledge.** §2 cites *evidence that raised the risk*, never a file as "where the failure lives." File:line anchors, function names, schema names, and module names are forbidden in §2 — they belong in `/10x-research`'s output, produced per rollout phase against current code. The plan is a QA spec; it is not a code audit.
- Coverage is not the metric. **Risk coverage** is the metric.

### Dual-layer mapping rules

- Classic layer first: the cheapest test that gives a real signal wins. Promote to e2e only when no cheaper layer covers the risk.
- AI-native layer second, and only where it adds signal classic tests do not give cheaply.
- Every AI-native row has a **"When NOT to use"** line. If you cannot write one, drop the row.
- Every tool name carries a `checked: <YYYY-MM-DD>` date. Tool names are examples of the category, not endorsements.
- Both layers must be non-empty in the final guide if the project warrants them. Classic-only is a 2020 plan; AI-native-only is hype. AI-native phases are not mandatory — include them only when the brief justified them under cost × signal.

### Quality gates rules

- Required gates (lint, typecheck, unit+integration, e2e on critical flows) must map to actual CI steps. If a required gate is not yet wired, mark it as `required after §3 Phase <N>` and let the named rollout phase wire it.
- Post-edit hook is **recommended local**, not a CI substitute.
- Multimodal visual review is **selective**, applied to 1–3 critical screens, not to every page.
- Vision-driven fallback (Anthropic Computer Use or OpenAI CUA) is reserved for DOM-unreachable surfaces; expensive per action.

### Cookbook patterns (§6) — fills in over time

`test-plan.md` is both a phased strategy and a **growing cookbook**. §6 starts as placeholders (`TBD — see §3 Phase <N>`) and fills in incrementally — each rollout phase's plan ends with a sub-phase that updates the relevant §6 entry (location, naming, reference test, run command). After Module 3 completes, §6 becomes the canonical answer to "how do I add a test for X in this project?" — and is what `/10x-tdd` reads in Lesson 2.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not write test code. That is Lesson 2 (`/10x-tdd` and unit-test authoring).
- Do not configure hooks, hook lifecycle, or debugging hooks. That is Lesson 3.
- Do not configure MCP servers, Playwright API, e2e code, or multimodal scenario code. That is Lesson 4.
- Do not run the bug-to-fix-to-regression-test workflow. That is Lesson 5.
- Do not author CI/CD pipelines from scratch or write GitHub Actions YAML. The guide names gates; configuration is owned by Module 1 Lesson 5 and Module 2 Lesson 5.
- Do not benchmark multimodal models. Cite criteria (cost, latency, agent-friendliness), never a ranking.
- Do not read the codebase for knowledge (call graphs, schemas, "which file owns this failure"). That is `/10x-research`'s job, per rollout phase.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/test-plan.md` — the quality contract produced and maintained by `/10x-test-plan`
- `context/foundation/prd.md` — primary risk source
- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` — likelihood weighting
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — stack input (when present)
- `context/archive/<change-id>/plan.md` — implemented risk surface
- `context/changes/<change-id>/` — per-rollout-phase change folder (one per row in §3)
