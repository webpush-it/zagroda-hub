## 10xDevs AI Toolkit — Module 1, Lesson 1

Bootstrap a greenfield project end-to-end with the **shaping chain**:

```
/10x-init  →  /10x-shape  →  /10x-prd  →  (10x-tech-stack-selector)  →  (bootstrapper)
```

The first three skills ship in this lesson; the last two are the next links in the chain.

### Task Router — Where to start

| Skill                   | Use it when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project setup**       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `/10x-init`             | The project directory is fresh. Scaffolds `context/foundation/lessons.md` and `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` so the rest of the workflow has somewhere to write. Run this once per project.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Discovery**           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `/10x-shape`            | You have an idea and need to turn it into structured shape-notes BEFORE writing a PRD. Greenfield only. Walks vision → persona/access → MVP → FRs (with Socratic challenge) → business logic & data → stack-openness sketch. Surfaces empty-CRUD and MVP-too-big anti-patterns by name. Output: `context/foundation/shape-notes.md` with a resumable `checkpoint:` block. |
| **Document generation** |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `/10x-prd`              | You have shape-notes (or raw notes) and want a schema-conformant `context/foundation/prd.md`. Generates against the locked schema, routes every gap verbatim into `## Open Questions`, and refuses to invent domain decisions. On collision, prompts overwrite vs. versioned save (`prd-vN.md`).                                                                          |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-init` produces the workflow v2 scaffold (`context/foundation/`, `lessons.md`, `contract-surfaces.md`). `/10x-shape` requires this and will offer to delegate to `/10x-init` if it's missing.
- `/10x-shape` writes `context/foundation/shape-notes.md` with frontmatter `checkpoint:` (current_phase, phases_completed, frs_drafted, quality_check_status). On re-entry, it resumes from the next unfinished phase.
- `/10x-prd` reads `shape-notes.md` (default) or any path you pass, scores the input on a 4-signal heuristic, warns on thin input, and writes `context/foundation/prd.md` against the schema at `skills/10x-shape/references/prd-schema.md` (frontmatter aligned 1:1 with 10x-tech-stack-selector's Q1–Q7).

### What the PRD captures (and what it does NOT)

- **Captured**: vision, persona, success criteria, user stories (Given/When/Then), FRs (FR-NNN), NFRs, business logic (one-sentence rule first), data model, access control, durable implementation decisions, testing strategy, deployment & CI/CD strategy, non-goals, open questions.
- **NOT captured (deliberate)**: framework choices, database choices, file paths, deployment platform. Stack openness is binding — only `product_type` and `tech_preferences.language_family` capture stack-shaped intent. Frameworks are 10x-tech-stack-selector's job.

### Anti-patterns surfaced during shaping

- **Empty-CRUD**: business logic that reduces to "users add and remove records" with no domain rule. `/10x-shape` names it explicitly and prompts for a real rule shape (recommendation, prioritization, classification, validation, scoring, workflow, calculation).
- **MVP-too-big**: first-flow estimate exceeds ~1 week of after-hours work, or > 4 distinct user actions before user-visible value, or requires multiple integrations before payoff. Skill names the expensive pieces and offers concrete scope-down moves.

Both are **soft gates**: they warn but allow override. Overrides are recorded in the checkpoint and surfaced in the PRD's `## Open Questions`.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/shape-notes.md` — `/10x-shape` output
- `context/foundation/prd.md` (or `prd-vN.md`) — `/10x-prd` output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` — recurring rules & pitfalls (scaffolded by `/10x-init`)
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` — load-bearing names registry (scaffolded by `/10x-init`)

### Universal language

The shipped skills carry no 10xDevs / cohort / certification references. The mechanics (Socratic challenge, gray-area discovery, recommended-answer fatigue mitigation, soft quality gate) are universal indicators of a well-scoped greenfield project.

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 5

Scale the single-change cycle into parallel work with **worktrees, goal-directed delegation, and multi-session orchestration**:

```
worktree per change -> /goal or claude -p -> PR -> review -> merge
```

The lesson focus is safe throughput: isolated contexts, choosing the right execution mode, and capping parallelism at review capacity.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Code isolation** | |
| `git worktree add` | You need a separate working directory for a parallel change. One change per worktree, one fresh agent context per worktree. |
| **Complex changes** | |
| `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | The change has multiple phases, needs manual gates, or benefits from interactive decision-making during execution. |
| **Simple changes** | |
| `/goal` | You have a clear, bounded task and want goal-directed delegation. The agent works autonomously toward the stated goal with a stop condition. |
| `claude -p` | You want headless execution for a well-defined task. The Ralph Wiggum loop (run, check, retry) is the universal autonomous pattern. |
| **Multi-session orchestration** | |
| Superset / Conductor / Antigravity / VS Code Agent View | You are running multiple agent sessions in parallel and need visibility, coordination, or session management across them. |

### Parallel work rules

- One change per worktree or isolated workspace. One fresh agent context per change.
- Choose interactive `/10x-implement` for complex changes, `/goal` or `claude -p` for simple ones.
- Parallelism is capped by review capacity. More agents without review means more unreviewed code, not higher throughput.
- The quality pain from faster shipping is intentional — it bridges into Module 3 testing gates.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not reteach interactive `/10x-implement` or `/10x-impl-review`; those are Lessons 2 and 3.
- Do not introduce testing strategy here. The quality pain is the motivation for Module 3.
- Worktrees are a mechanism for isolation, not the topic of a full git tutorial.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/` - active change folder
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - implementation input for any execution mode

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
